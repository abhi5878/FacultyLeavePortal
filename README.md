Leave application portal and research profile for faculty for university

Here I have developed a faculty leave portal for university. Where a leave application follows a pre-specified route (defined by admin).
For application in process faculty and and corresponding authority can comment and reoute the application, or approve/reject the application. This software also allows the hiring or removal of faculty, and promotion to HoD/Dean. Hiring authority have been only provided to only Director.
I have used plpgsql for writing the heart of this system. And have used flask for integration of back-end and front-end.

There is also the second part of this project, in which we designed a public research profile for each faculty which is publicly accessible. Each faculty has the option to manage their profile by altering information shown on their public page. To implement this part we have used a non-relational database , mondoDB.
